        "A face recognition system is a fast-growing technology and it has plethora of applications nowadays. The reason to choose this paper is to know emerging approaches applied in face recognition system to get accuracy under the constraint of variation in lighting and facial expression. Peter N. Belhumeur, Jo~ao P. Hespanha, and David J. Kriegman have written this paper to propose a novel algorithm. \n",

        "This paper is about a face recognition technique developed by the authors by using a pattern classification approach. In this paper, a new approach to face recognition is introduced and explained briefly. Also, comparisons are made between the face recognition algorithm developed by the authors \"Fisherface\" and the “Eigenface” technique. After experimenting on the Yale and Harvard face databases comprehensively, it was found that the \"Fisherface\" technique is more accurate than the \"Eigenface\" technique. \n",
        "Their approach is based on the following observations: \n",
        "a.\tFrom a fixed viewpoint, the images of a Lambertian surface under different illumination lie in a three-dimensional subspace of a high dimensional space.  \n",
        "b.\tThe above statement is not valid if there exists region of shadow, regular reflections and various expressions that deviates from actual image resulting in less reliable for recognition. \n",
        "By utilizing these observations authors tried to find different projection of faces from high dimensional image which exclude variation in lighting and facial expressions to notably lower dimensional space. Here to achieve this the authors derived an algorithm named “Fisherface” which is based on Fisher’s Linear Discriminate (FLD) where it elucidates how to increase the ratio of between class scatter matrix to that of within class scatter matrix. \n",
        "In addition to that, the article describes Eigenface approach to achieve the abovementioned observations. This approach is based on linearly projecting image space using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to lower dimension image space. \n",
        " \n",
        "Innovation \n",
        "\n",
        "The Algorithm proposed by the authors is logically explained and derived from FLD. Looking back at the time the paper was written, it was original and innovative as they took the existing Fisher’s Linear Discriminant and used it to derive their “Fisherface” algorithm. \n",
        "They have contributed a new algorithm for facial recognition. Further they compared the accuracy of Fisherface and Eigenface algorithm by performing test on face databases of Yale and Harvard. \n",
        "This article describes four appropriate approaches to address abovementioned observations and compared each method to achieve utmost accuracy in face recognition problem. These approaches include:  \n",
        "a.\tCorrelation: It is one of the simplest classification techniques which uses nearest neighbor algorithm where it recognizes the nearest point in the labelled learning dataset and dataset refers to image space.  Best image space is said to be correlated with the test data if it has a unit variance and zero normalization. This specifies that it is insensitive to light variance and facial expressions. The limitation of the correlation is high computation time and it requires large storage to achieve facial recognition system. \n",
        "b.\tEigenface: Commonly used technique to reduce dimensionality in computer vision. This is the method which employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to achieve face recognition. PCA technique maximizes the scatter of all projection. Drawback of using PCA is that while increasing between class scatter it also increases within class scatter as well. This leads to increase in unwanted information which is later discarded in PCA. \n",
        "c.\tLinear Subspaces: Both techniques mentioned above do not exploit the observations made and hence fail to achieve facial recognition problem. So linear subspace which utilizes the observation and considered to be good technique for a Lambertian surface without shadowing. This is a well-known method called as photo metrics stereo in which it considers image as a Lambertian surface where it takes 3 or more images of same dimensionality in high dimension as a training dataset. To compute recognition problem, it measures shortest distance to the image space. This is considered as linear subspace method. The drawback is that it only works when the given surface is a Lambertian surface.  \n",
        "d.\tFisherface: It is one of the well-known methods which takes the benefits of the Eigenface and linear subspace. Fisherface technique uses the labelled training dataset to sense the information and reduces dimensionality to get more reliable method in high dimension space. This technique employs class specific method, which shapes the scatter to make it more reliable classification.    \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "To evaluate the class specific linear projection article supported a comparison of PCA and FLD using two class problem. In this comparison they have taken samples from each class and randomly selected in direction orthogonal to linear subspace. In this illustration both techniques projected the points from 2D to 1D. The PCA smears the classes and they are no longer linearly separable. PCA achieves a maximum total scatter whereas FLD achieves better between class scatter than within class scatter. The PCA technique is always singular and the pixel image is larger than the number of images in the learning set. Fisherface is a better computation technique to overcome this criterion. It sets actual images in lower dimensional space resulting in non-singular within class scatter.  \n",

        "The author of this paper critically evaluated the problem regarding facial recognition system and clearly outlined two observations on which the proposed algorithm “Fisherface” is centered. In the beginning of the article, they evidently described four patterns of classifications, namely Correlation, Linear Subspace, Eigenface, and Fisherface. These classifications consider variation in light that includes direction, intensity and number of sources of light, and facial expression. This enables the reader to understand the problem clearly. Moreover, the authors stated the disadvantages of each classification. This article addresses the disadvantages of each classification and tries to overcome it in every computational step. Authors compared PCA and FLD in this paper to achieve better between class scatter matrix using mathematical calculations and plotted graph. This represents good analysis and computational research done by the authors to obtain better results. They have collected two different databases to understand the problem of variation in light and different facial expressions. \n",
        "They presented appropriate experimental results and different hypothesis like glass recognition, variation in facial expression, eyewear and lightning. These experimental results demonstrate different subsets and portrays Fisherface has low error rates and comparatively less computational time is required.  Finally, they have concluded that Fisherface method is the best algorithm to solve the problem of face recognition. However, it reflects that they straight away came to this conclusion without displaying the technical calculation and reasoning. Therefore, the quality of the paper is good to understand the problem but because of absence of logical explanation in detail the paper is only satisfactory when it comes to resolving the problem.  \n",

        "\n",
        "The proposed technique “Fisherface” in this article is suitable for the stated application domain of face recognition.  \n",
        "The Gabriel Fisher classifier which is insensitive to variation in lighting and facial expressions. It applies the enhanced Fisher linear discriminant model to a large Gabor feature. Face recognition accuracy using GFC is very high.  (Liu & Wechsler 2002) \n",
        "A neural network-based expression recognition applying fisherface algorithm has been designed and implemented. The facial expression features can be extracted with the help of Fisherface method and the facial expressions are recognized with the help of a neural network (Abidin & Harjoko 2012). \n",
        "The Fisher face algorithm mostly targets the linear problems. Therefore, it should be generalized. Kernel Fisherface method was developed which generalizes and takes high order correlations into account (Zhou et al. 2008).\n",
        "Further research could be done by using Fisherface technique on a large dataset to see how well it performs on huge amount of data. Researching different individuals under the same lighting condition to deal with the variation in lighting. In addition, current face detection techniques do not work under extreme lighting conditions and hence new recognition methods are needed to support the Fisherface algorithm. \n",
        "I believe the work explained in this paper provides a good point of debate and discussion which may facilitate a lot of thinking and questioning about the proposed algorithm. Also, discussions about the datasets used and the various conditions under which the proposed technique could be efficient or could break down. \n",
        "I find it interesting how pattern classification approach is used to develop a face recognition model. Also, the interesting thing about this paper is the way they compared the two approaches “Fisherface” derived by using FLD and “Eigenface” derived by using PCA. They performed a test on Yale and Harvard Face databases which helped in providing a conclusion for given dataset. \n",
        "Appearance of an expression may vary from person to person. I strongly believe that facial expressions recognition is a thought-provoking task. Also, some expressions are ambiguous which make them hard to distinguish. This is interesting and might be an important element to improve the accuracy of recognition for the future researchers (Abidin & Harjoko 2012).\n",

        "The article is systematically structured. The article begins with a relevant problem of face recognition systems followed by observations which are exploited to develop the proposed algorithm. They derived four approaches and clearly stated limitations of each approach. The paper has compared two different techniques to give readers better understanding of the relevant solution to the problem. In addition, authors have given satisfactory mathematical calculations with explanatory graphs. However, authors could have provided more detailed explanations. The paper could have included more self-explanatory images. The authors could have done more in depth comparisons with different training datasets to obtain maximum accuracy in face recognition method. \n",
        "Overall, the article is well-organized and consists of logical concepts illustrating every aspect of approaches described in the introduction. \n",
